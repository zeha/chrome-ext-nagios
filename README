This is a Google Chrome extension.

As far as I understand it, you need to have Chrome 4.x to use this.

Also for installation, you need to replace all NAGIOS_HOST occurences 
with your Nagios v2 hostname.

Then go to chrome://extensions/ and click "Load unpacked extension".

For licensing, please see the file COPYING.


Good luck!
